# sidekiq-dirty-exit

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sidekiq-dirty-exit'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## NOTE

This gem changes some internal functionality of sidekiq that might break pro and enterprise
setups. So I would not recommend using it on those scenarios. And you probably
dont need to, the use for this gem is not needed if you have reliable queueing.

## Usage

No need to do anything just adding the gem will enable dirty exit tracking.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
